[![Code Quality][codacy-image]][codacy]

This repository contains Python code to data-mine ratings at the Epic Games Store (EGS).

![Ranking of games based on the Bayesian average rating][img-cover]

## Disclaimer

The leak has been plugged, so the code cannot fetch `ratingCount` directly from Epic Games anymore.

> **Note**
> As of December 15, 2022, the official ranking seems to be using Bayesian average ratings! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰
> 
> For comparison:
> - [the latest unofficial ranking][unofficial-ranking-latest], on September 24, 2022,
> - [the official ranking][official-ranking-new-sorting-order], on December 15, 2022.

> **Note**
> Unfortunately, the official ranking was reverted back to using **raw** ratings later on the same day.

> **Note**
> As of August 31, 2023, the official ranking uses a mysterious sorting order! ðŸ˜±

> For investigation:

## Requirements

-   Install the latest version of [Python 3.X][python-download-url].
-   Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To retrieve the `pageSlug` for every store product, run:
```bash
python download_store_products.py
```
Caveat: different store products can be associated with the same `pageSlug`, despite having different `title` values.

To retrieve the `sandboxId` associated with every `pageSlug`, run:
```bash
python download_sandbox_ids.py
```

To retrieve the ratings associated with every `sandboxId`, run:
```bash
python download_game_ratings.py
```

To export trimmed results to JSON and CSV, run:
```bash
python export_results.py
```

Alternatively:

-   Run [`epic-games-ratings.ipynb`][colab-notebook]
